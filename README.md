# Perlin Noise Terrain Generator
This is a Terrain Generator based on Perlin Noise. This works by generating a height map using perlin noise and then applying that height map to the Terrain.
Make sure that the Terrain height map resolution is always set to **(2^n) + 1**, setting it a random number would result in a weird looking terrain
